# Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information in an aesthetic, modern, and responsive layout.

## Overview

This portfolio website serves as a professional platform to highlight my background, skills, and accomplishments as a software engineer. It includes a visually appealing and interactive layout with sections for `About Me`, `Skills`, `Projects`, and `Contact Information`. The website is designed to provide a smooth user experience with scroll-triggered animations, a clean monochrome color scheme, and hover effects.

## Project Design

The website follows a minimalist design approach with black, white, and cream colors for a sophisticated look. It includes the following features:

- **Responsive Layout:** Ensures that the website is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Smooth Navigation:** The website includes a `navbar` at the top and a `footer` for seamless navigation.
- **Scroll Animations:** Scroll-triggered animations enhance the viewing experience as users explore different sections.
- **Hover Effects:** Interactive elements have hover effects for improved user engagement.

## Sections

1. **Welcome:** Introduction with profile picture, job title, and links to download the CV or contact information.
2. **About Me:** A brief summary of my background, achievements, education, and experience.
3. **Skills:** Categorized into `programming languages`, `frontend frameworks`, `backend/databases`, and `version control tools`.
4. **Projects:** Highlights my recent projects with links to GitHub repositories and live demos.
5. **Contact Me:** Provides options to reach me via `email` or `LinkedIn`.

## Test Cases

To ensure functionality, the website should meet the following requirements:

1. **Welcome Section:** Contains an `<h1>` element with a unique `id`, without any empty elements.
2. **Projects Section:** Includes at least one element with a `project` link and `target="_blank"` attribute.
3. **Accessibility:** Supports screen readers and includes appropriate `alt` attributes for images.
4. **Responsiveness:** Adapts to different screen sizes with hover and scroll effects.
5. **Media Query for Dark/Light Mode:** Allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.
